1. To simplify test generation, we limit each event to happen at most once in a test case. Thus, in Repetition Constraints, we set 0<= Event.# <=1.

2. # of t-way permutations (t = 1, 2, 3, 4) are the test requirements to be covered by the tests.

3. In our results, readers may only focus on the Generation Time and Final Results. Ohter parts in the results are the recording contents of test generation.
